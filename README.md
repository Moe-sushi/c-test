# What's this?
As a noob, sometimes I need to test some simple program like `for(int i=0;i<10;i+=2)` to see what will happen, but I don't want to include headers needed for the program every time.      
So I wrote this simple script, it will automatically create an empty C program with the most header I need, it's a while loop, press c to clear and press q to exit.
